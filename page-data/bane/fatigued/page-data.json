They retain any armor, extraordinary, or feat bonuses.</li>\n<li><strong>Level 5</strong> - The target loses consciousness and is helpless.

Each 24 hour period of rest with little or no exertion removes one level of fatigue.

If the *restoration* boon's invoker has an attribute score of 7 or greater, all levels of fatigue are removed instead of just one. A target may only benefit from one invocation of the *restoration* boon to remove fatigue within a 24 hour period.\n","fields":{"slug":"/bane/fatigued"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/bane/fatigued","name":"Fatigued"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3366224840"]}
