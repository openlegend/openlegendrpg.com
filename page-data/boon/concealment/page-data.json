This causes all such elements of the chosen type to be suppressed within 5’ of the target though extraordinary means, making it very difficult to detect. The target gains advantage according to the boon’s Power Level on Action rolls to hide and/or remain undetected.\n<br>\nWhen making attacks against enemies that are unable to detect the target, their Guard defense is reduced. Likewise, the target’s Guard defense is increased against enemies that can not detect them, though is unchanged against area attacks.\n<br>\nYou cannot be the target of opportunity attacks unless the enemy is somehow aware of your location through another sensory element, applicable attribute roll, or other effect that allows them to locate you. This opportunity attack may be subject to disadvantage (0, 3, or 5) as determined by the GM for the given situation.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Power Level 3</strong> - Invoker is able to conceal either Scent or Sound.
