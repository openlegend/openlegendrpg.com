In addition, at power levels 4 and lower, the target does not gain mastery over any special movement modes granted by the new form. As such, the movement speed is cut in half for movement modes not native to the original form, and the GM may rule that certain actions, such as swimming in combat, suffer disadvantage on relevant action rolls.\\n"},{"name":"Summon Creature","tags":["Extraordinary"],"power":[4,5,6,7,8,9],"attribute":["Alteration","Creation","Entropy","Energy"],"invocationTime":"1 Focus Action","duration":"Sustain Persists","description":"You summon forth a creature to assist your cause, whether they are animals called from the wild, undead minions built from the remains of your foes, or worker bots constructed of spare parts from a salvage yard.
