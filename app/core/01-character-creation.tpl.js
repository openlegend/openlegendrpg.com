This chapter will offer you step-by-step instructions to create your own hero. In Open Legend, you typically begin as a level one character. As you complete missions or quests and gain more experience as a hero, you’ll level up and gain more power. These rules explain how to create a character starting at level one. Later, you’ll learn what to do when you level up.</p><p>Before reading on, take a minute and think of your favorite movies, books, or video games.</p><p><em>Who were the characters you identified with?</em></p><p><em>Who inspired you?</em></p><p>Now that you’ve got some of your favorites in mind, let’s create your character.</p><blockquote><h3 id="pre-generated-characters-to-get-you-started">Pre-generated Characters to Get You Started</h3><p>If you would like some character inspiration or an easy place to start, you can browse the pre-generated characters linked below. If you find a character you would like to use, simply copy the spreadsheet and adjust as you see fit. The spreadsheets include formulas to do most of the calculations for you, and you can adjust the <strong>Level</strong> field to generate the appropriate number of feat and attribute points if you are creating a character above first level.</p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0Bx_UrXHMi3wmUlJjbDZiaGtIX00"><strong>View Pre-generated Character Options</strong></a></p></blockquote><h2 id="step-1-describe-your-character">Step 1: Describe Your Character</h2><p>Open Legend is a role playing game, which means your character will need more depth than merely a selection of attributes, feats, perks, and gear. To make your character come to life, add some of the following details. If you can’t think of anything yet, try to fill in the blanks during your first couple of play sessions as you get to know your character better.</p><p><strong>A heroic name.</strong> Be sure to check with your GM to see if they have any particular setting in mind. Phil the Fighter would feel quite out of place next to Therilas Windcaster and Gorion Skullcleaver.</p><p><strong>Your race.</strong> Your decision of race is limited only by your imagination, the setting, and the constraints provided by your GM. A typical fantasy campaign might feature dwarves, elves, halflings, celestials, and dragon-blooded. If you are playing in a futuristic space opera on the fringes of the galaxy, your GM might have several alien races to choose from. Some campaigns, such as a mystery of Lovecraftian horror, might allow only for regular old humans. Really, though, as long as it is approved by your GM, you can play anything you would like, whether that’s a psionic humanoid tiger, a 3-inch tall pixie, or anything in between.</p><p>As part of deciding your race, you should also choose your <strong>size</strong>: small, medium, or large. A medium character is roughly the size of an average human. Small creatures range from about 2 - 4 feet in height, while large creatures are about 7 - 10 feet tall. A large creature occupies a 10’x10’ square in combat and has a 10’ reach (see Chapter 7: Combat for details). The GM may assign advantage or disadvantage during situations in which your size is relevant. For example, small creatures may gain advantage on rolls to hide and receive disadvantage on rolls to kick down a door. Likewise, large creatures might suffer disadvantage on attack rolls when fighting in confined spaces but gain advantage on rolls to intimidate smaller creatures.</p><p>At the GM’s discretion, you may choose to be even smaller or larger than the listed sizes. A large creature’s reach is always equal to the length of its base. So, a giant with a 15’x15’ base would have a 15’ reach. All creatures always have at least a 5’ reach.</p><blockquote><h3 id="no-racial-abilities-or-adjustments">No Racial Abilities or Adjustments?</h3><p>In Open Legend, races do not provide specific mechanical costs and benefits. Instead, you’ll have a chance to further define your character in a later step of character creation by choosing your perks and flaws. Some or all of your decisions at that stage may be influenced by your race, and you are encouraged to explain to the rest of your group how your race informs your choice of perks and flaws. For example, if you are playing a psionic humanoid tiger, you might choose the <em>scent</em> perk to highlight your hunter’s bloodline and the <em>observant</em> perk to simulate your extrasensory perception. Likewise, you could select the <em>hot tempered</em> flaw to represent the savage animal that still lurks beneath your intelligent outer shell.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Two exceptional physical traits.</strong> Think of the first two features that other characters notice when they see you. Do your eyes glow red when you are angry? Are you seven feet tall? Is your hair a rainbow hue?</p><p><strong>Two defining social traits.</strong> Maybe you stutter when you’re nervous. Maybe you don’t trust anyone until they’ve proven themselves to you. Or, perhaps, you are a winsome bard who almost always talks in sing-song. Your two social traits should be characteristics that others will learn shortly after getting to know you.</p><p><strong>A secret.</strong> Your secret is something that other characters probably won’t find out about until they’ve gotten to know you quite well. It’s also a seed for great adventure that the GM can weave into the campaign.</p><blockquote><h3 id="example-character-secrets">Example Character Secrets</h3><p>Before Volkor changed his name and began wandering the land as a barbarian sellsword, he was heir to the throne.</p><hr><p>Sir Thomas Tuckburrough served as an assassin for the local thieves guild until a job went bad and he murdered an innocent child—that’s when he began his road to the priesthood.</p><hr><p>Talia suffered from a horrible car accident as a youth. She only survived because a mad street doctor found her body and kept it alive with a number of cybernetic implants that have left her half machine, both physically and mentally.</p></blockquote><h2 id="step-2-choose-attributes">Step 2: Choose Attributes</h2><p>Attributes are the backbone of every character in Open Legend. They define what your character can and can’t do—the spheres they excel in, as well as their greatest weaknesses. Whenever your character attempts a heroic action in Open Legend, you’ll look to your attributes to see how well you succeed or fail.</p><p>In Open Legend, attributes are divided into four categories: physical, social, mental, and extraordinary.</p><p>A character’s skill with each attribute is expressed as a score from 0 (completely unpracticed) to 9 (superhuman). A character cannot use an extraordinary attribute if they have a score of zero, though physical, social, and mental attributes may still be used untrained.</p><p>The average commoner or craftsman usually has scores ranging from 1 - 3 in several physical, social, and mental attributes. Extraordinary attributes are generally reserved for characters of power and note.</p><p>The Attributes at a Glance tables provide a quick overview of some of the common actions that each attribute will help you accomplish. All of the attributes are explained in further detail in Chapter 2: Actions and Attributes.</p><div class="table-no-body"></div><table><thead><tr class="header"><th><strong>Physical Attributes at a Glance</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td></td></tr></tbody></table><table style="width:10%;"><colgroup><col width="2%"><col width="6%"></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Agility</strong></td><td>Dodge attacks, move with stealth, perform acrobatics, shoot a bow, pick a pocket</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Fortitude</strong></td><td>Resist poison, shrug off pain, survive in a desert, wear heavy armor</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Might</strong></td><td>Swing a maul, jump over a chasm, break down a door, wrestle a foe to submission</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="table-no-body"></div><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Mental Attributes at a Glance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="table-no-head thirty-seventy"></div><table style="width:6%;"><colgroup><col width="2%"><col width="2%"></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Learning</strong></td><td>Recall facts about history, arcane magic, the natural world, or any information you picked up from an external source</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Logic</strong></td><td>Innovate a new crafting method, decipher a code, jury-rig a device, get the gist of a language you don’t speak</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Perception</strong></td><td>Sense ulterior motives, track someone, catch a gut feeling, spot a hidden foe, find a secret door</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Will</strong></td><td>Maintain your resolve, resist torture, study long hours, stay awake on watch, stave off insanity</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="table-no-body"></div><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Social Attributes at a Glance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="table-no-head thirty-seventy"></div><table style="width:6%;"><colgroup><col width="2%"><col width="2%"></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Deception</strong></td><td>Tell a lie, bluff at cards, disguise yourself, spread rumors, swindle a sucker</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Persuasion</strong></td><td>Negotiate a deal, convince someone, haggle a good price, pry information</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Presence</strong></td><td>Give a speech, sing a song, inspire an army, exert your force of personality, have luck smile upon you</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="table-no-body"></div><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Extraordinary Attributes at a Glance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="table-no-head thirty-seventy"></div><table style="width:6%;"><colgroup><col width="2%"><col width="2%"></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Alteration</strong></td><td>Change shape, alter molecular structures, transmute one material into another</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Creation</strong></td><td>Channel higher powers, manifest something from nothing, regenerate, divinely bolster</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Energy</strong></td><td>Create and control the elements—fire, cold, electricity</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Entropy</strong></td><td>Disintegrate matter, kill with a word, create undead, sicken others</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Influence</strong></td><td>Control the minds of others, speak telepathically, instill fear, create illusory figments, cloak with invisibility</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Movement</strong></td><td>Teleport, fly, hasten, telekinetically push</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Prescience</strong></td><td>See the future, read minds or auras, view from afar, detect magic or evil, communicate with extraplanar entities</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Protection</strong></td><td>Protect from damage, break supernatural influence, dispel magic, exile extradimensional beings</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In Open Legend, you get to define your character’s strengths and weaknesses by choosing the attributes that fit your character concept.

You have three defense scores, and each one protects you from different types of attacks. The higher your defense, the better you are at avoiding or shrugging off whatever your foes throw at you.</p><div class="table-no-body table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Toughness = 10 + Fortitude + Will</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Toughness</strong> protects you from attacks that test your endurance, bodily health, sturdiness, and survivability.

If they reach zero, you fall unconscious and are at risk of death.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> indicates how far your character can move using a single move action (see Chapter 7: Combat). Your base speed is 30 feet. Other effects, such as banes, boons, and feats may cause your speed to increase or decrease.</p><h2 id="step-4-purchase-feats">Step 4: Purchase Feats</h2><p>While your character’s attributes define your skill at accomplishing heroic tasks, your <strong>feats</strong> are what make you unique among other characters. Feats allow you to customize your character, granting you the ability to accomplish specific actions exceptionally well.</p><p>For example, two different characters who specialize in melee combat might both start with a Might score of 5. However, one character is a swashbuckling pirate, so she takes the <em>Combat Momentum</em> feat to move deftly from one foe to the next like a whirling dervish. The other, a battle-scarred barbarian, takes <em>Battle Trance</em> so that he can fly into a frenzied rage in order to decimate foes.</p><h3 id="choose-your-feats">Choose Your Feats</h3><p>Feats are purchased using feat points. At 1st level, you have 6 feat points to spend. Any leftover feat points may be saved for the future.</p><p>You can read the feat descriptions in a searchable list <a href="http://www.openlegendrpg.com/feats"><em>here</em></a>.</p><h2 id="step-5-choose-starting-equipment">Step 5: Choose Starting Equipment</h2><p>In a typical game of Open Legend, your character will start with the gear they need for the basic adventuring life. The GM, however, may decide that the campaign starts under special circumstances (such as the entire party caged in a slave convoy) that might dictate otherwise.</p><p>Usually, though, you begin with a wealth score of 2, and may select up to three items of wealth level 2 and any number of items of a lesser wealth level. See chapter 6 for rules concerning wealth as well as equipment details. After selecting your equipment, be sure to note any changes to your defenses or other statistics.</p><h2 id="step-6-choose-perks-and-flaws">Step 6: Choose Perks and Flaws</h2><p>Perks and flaws provide you with additional ways to define your character’s personality, appearance, strengths, weaknesses, and background. Complete descriptions of the available perks and flaws, as well as how they are used in play, are described in Chapter 5: Perks &amp; Flaws.</p><p>At character creation, you may optionally choose up to two perks and up to two flaws. You do not have to choose any.</p><h2 id="step-7-tell-your-story">Step 7: Tell Your Story</h2><p>With your character created, you are all ready to start playing Open Legend. Whether you’re playing with old friends or complete strangers, and whether you’re completely new to roleplaying games or an experienced veteran, the following tips will help ensure a fun time for everyone at the table.</p><h3 id="relax">Relax</h3><p>Open Legend gives you a chance to step out of everyday life for a few hours and into a fantastical world where you can perform heroic deeds. Pour the Mountain Dew or grab a beer, order some takeout or pop open the pretzels—but whatever you do, shake the dice like your character’s life depends on it and have fun. If you’re playing a dwarf, maybe pull out your best Scottish accent. If your character’s a witch, squint your eyes and speak in riddles. If you’re no expert thespian, think of other ways to add to the fun: play adventurous music on your phone, illustrate the party’s escapades, and so on.</p><h3 id="respect-the-gm">Respect the GM</h3><p>If you’ve never GM’d before, you might not realize all the work that goes into it. More likely than not, your GM worked for hours to put their campaign together and prep for this session. Go with their storyline, overlook any accidental inconsistencies, and don’t cause a ruckus just for the sake of causing a ruckus. If there’s a dispute over the rules, accept the GM’s final ruling and agree to look it up later for the sake of keeping the game going.</p><h3 id="respect-the-other-players">Respect the Other Players</h3><p>Different people play roleplaying games for different reasons. Some enjoy the tactical, chess-like combat encounters. Others just want to tell an epic story. Still others are born actors, reveling in every conversation with every character. Whatever it is that you enjoy about playing Open Legend, just remember that not everyone else at the table may enjoy the same aspects. The GM is there to help every character shine, but you can help by not hogging the spotlight and by encouraging the other players to have fun, whatever that means for them.</p><h2 id="archetype-builds">Archetype Builds</h2><p>This section contains an assortment of characters built for a variety of genres. If you do not want to create your own character from scratch, you can use these as is. Just add your own perks, flaws, and descriptive traits and you are ready to go. Alternatively, you might use one of these archetypes to get you started, swapping out attributes and feats to develop your own unique character concept for the setting that you will be playing in.</p><h3 id="bard">Bard</h3><p>Bards are a little bit of everything: leaders, loremasters, artists, performers, magicians, swashbucklers, and more. A bard is a jack-of-all-trades who gets allies out of the frying pan just as often as they land them in the fire.</p><h4 id="strategy">Strategy</h4><p>Bards can lend a helping hand in almost any non-combat scenario by using their <em>well-rounded</em> feat, though they particularly excel in social situations thanks to their strong Presence and Persuasion attributes. Their Influence score also provides access to banes such as <em>charmed</em> and <em>phantasm</em>, which can be useful for deceiving enemies, winning them over, or prying information out of them.</p><p>In combat, a Bard supports allies with <em>bolster</em>, using the <em>boon focus</em> feat to inspire as many allies as possible at once. When friends are wounded, the Bard uses <em>heal</em> to get them back in the fight, and can even help several allies hold the line by invoking a healing <em>aura</em>. Bards are reasonably adept in melee combat, using their rapier to disarm foes whenever the opportunity presents itself.</p><p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 3 (1d8), Learning 3 (1d8), Will 3 (1d8), Presence 4 (1d10), Persuasion 3 (1d8), Influence 3 (1d8)</p><p><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 24<br><strong>Guard:</strong> 14 (15 with shield - Agility 3, Leather Armor 1)<br><strong>Toughness:</strong> 13<br><strong>Resolve:</strong> 17<br><strong>Speed:</strong> 30’</p><p><strong>Feats:</strong> Well-rounded, Boon Focus I (Bolster), Great Leap</p><p><strong>Notable Equipment:</strong> Leather Armor, Rapier (treat as Longsword), Small Shield, Lore Book, Musical Instrument</p><p><strong>Favored Actions</strong><br><em><strong>Rapier</strong></em> (damaging attack): Agility vs. Guard<br><em><strong>En Garde!</strong></em> (inflict <em>disarm</em>): Agility vs. Guard, advantage 1<br><em><strong>Inspiring Word</strong></em> (invoke <em>bolster</em>):<br>=&gt; 1 target: Auto-success of PL 3 via <em>boon focus</em><br>=&gt; 10’ cube: Presence vs. 16 (PL 3)<br><em><strong>Healing Word</strong></em> (invoke <em>heal</em>): Presence vs. 12 - 18 (PL 1 - 4)<br><em><strong>Song of Vivification</strong></em> (invoke 5’ <em>aura: heal</em>): Presence vs. 18 (PL 4)<br><em><strong>Winning Smile</strong></em> (inflict <em>charmed</em>): Influence vs. Resolve<br><em><strong>Magic Trick</strong></em> (inflict <em>phantasm</em>): Influence vs. Resolve</p><h3 id="battle-mage">Battle Mage</h3><p>Battle Mages are masters of might and magic. Gifted with innate talents for melee combat and elemental sorcery, these elite soldiers are a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield. The Battle Mage is typically heavily armored, equipped with a variety of close combat weapons, and crackling with raw magical energy.</p><h4 id="strategy-1">Strategy</h4><p>The Battle Mages were born and bred for combat, but they can still hold their own in some non-combat situations. They are typically strong leaders who carry an intimidating aura, capable of commanding attention when the circumstances demand it.</p><p>In combat, Battle Mages serve as a one man front line brute squad. Their heavy armor makes them nearly impervious to lesser foes, and their command over the element of ice allow them to control the battlefield with area attacks. Making use of the <em>multi-target attack specialist</em> feat, they can attack multiple foes without hindrance. When enemies do manage to outmaneuver their wintry gusts and icy bolts, Battle Mages are ready to engage in hand to hand combat with an arsenal of weaponry for any occasion.</p><p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 2 (1d6), Fortitude 3 (1d8), Might 4 (1d10), Presence 3 (1d8), Energy 5 (2d6)<br><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 22<br><strong>Guard:</strong> 20 (21 with shield - Agility 2, Might 4, Full Plate Armor 3, Feat 1)<br><strong>Toughness:</strong> 13<br><strong>Resolve:</strong> 13<br><strong>Speed:</strong> 25’</p><p><strong>Feats:</strong> Multi-Target Attack Specialist II (Area), Armor Mastery I</p><p><strong>Notable Equipment:</strong> Full Plate Armor, Small Shield, Longsword, Longspear, Mace</p><p><strong>Favored Actions</strong><br><em><strong>Icy Bolt</strong></em> (damaging attack): Energy vs. Guard<br><em><strong>Earthquake</strong></em> (damaging attack, 10’ cube): Energy vs. Guard<br><em><strong>Frostbite</strong></em> (inflict <em>persistent damage,</em> 10’ cube): Energy vs. Guard<br><em><strong>Tremor</strong></em> (inflict <em>knockdown,</em> 10’ cube): Energy vs. Guard<br><em><strong>Quicksand</strong></em> (inflict <em>immobile</em>, 10’ cube): Energy vs. Toughness<br><em><strong>Longsword</strong></em> (damaging attack): Might vs. Guard<br><em><strong>Longspear</strong></em> (damaging attack, 10’ reach): Might vs. Guard, advantage 1</p><h3 id="beast-master">Beast Master</h3><p>The Beast Master summons and commands the creatures of the wild, and is capable of taming even monsters of great legend, such as dragons and manticores.</p><h4 id="strategy-2">Strategy</h4><p>The Beast Master commands a legendary manticore, which serves as both mount and combatant. The manticore’s flight allows the Beast Master access to areas that might be out of reach for the rest of the party. Out of combat, Beast Masters can use their Influence attribute to soothe and command a wide array of animals and mythical beasts, gradually winning their loyalty.</p><p>Once combat ensues, the Beast Master takes to the sky, picking off foes with a longbow and commanding dominated creatures to gain control over the battlefield. When their arrows aren’t getting the job done, the Beast Master doesn’t hesitate to close into melee and let the manticore tear foes to shreds with its razor sharp claws or disable them with its venomous sting.</p><p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 4 (1d10), Fortitude 2 (1d6), Might 1 (1d4), Perception 3 (1d8), Will 2 (1d6), Presence 1 (1d4), Influence 5 (2d6)<br><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 24<br><strong>Guard:</strong> 17 (Agility 4, Might 1, Breastplate 2)<br><strong>Toughness:</strong> 14<br><strong>Resolve:</strong> 13<br><strong>Speed:</strong> 30’</p><p><strong>Feats:</strong> Companion III</p><p><strong>Notable Equipment:</strong> Breastplate, Longbow, Longspear</p><p><strong>Favored Actions</strong><br><em><strong>Longbow</strong></em> (damaging attack): Agility vs. Guard<br><em><strong>Barbed Arrow</strong></em> (inflict <em>persistent damage</em>): Agility vs. Guard, advantage 1<br><em><strong>Longspear</strong></em> (damaging attack, 10’ reach): Agility vs. Guard, advantage 1<br><em><strong>Charm Beast</strong></em> (inflict <em>charmed</em>): Influence vs. Resolve<br><em><strong>Command Beast</strong></em> (inflict <em>dominated</em>): Influence vs. Resolve</p><h4 id="manticore-companion">Manticore Companion</h4><p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 1 (1d4), Fortitude 3 (1d8), Might 4 (1d10), Perception 1 (1d4), Will 2 (1d6), Entropy 5 (2d6)<br><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 20<br><strong>Guard:</strong> 15 (Agility 1, Might 4)<br><strong>Toughness:</strong> 15<br><strong>Resolve:</strong> 12<br><strong>Speed:</strong> 30’ flying</p><p><strong>Feats:</strong> Flying</p><p><strong>Favored Actions</strong><br><em><strong>Claws</strong></em> (damaging attack): Might vs. Guard<br><em><strong>Deadly Sting</strong></em> (damaging attack): Entropy vs. Guard<br><em><strong>Toxic Sting</strong></em> (inflict <em>persistent damage</em>): Entropy vs. Toughness<br><em><strong>Takedown</strong></em> (inflict <em>knockdown</em>): Might vs. Guard<br><em><strong>Disorienting Sting</strong></em> (inflict <em>stunned</em>): Entropy vs. Toughness</p><h3 id="berserker">Berserker</h3><p>Berserkers are the elite frontline forces of the barbarian hordes, known for surmounting impossible odds. Those who don’t fall beneath the terror of their frenzied rage will tell tales of the Berserkers’ mighty thews that will be the stuff of nightmares for generations to come.</p><h4 id="strategy-3">Strategy</h4><p>Berserkers are born and bred for the sole purpose of slaying foes. Outside of combat, they can occasionally lend a hand by bending bars, lifting gates, or intimidating foes.</p><p>Once combat ensues, the Berserker is a near unstoppable killing machine. Their two handed axe combined with a Might score of 5 ensures that the Berserker will dish out considerable damage. They have exceptionally high defenses, so Berserkers are always willing to call out foes with the <em>provoked</em> bane. In particularly difficult fights, they will activate their <em>battle trance</em> to fly into a rage, making their attacks even more deadly and further improving their survivability. Berserkers must use their rage sparingly, however, as entering a <em>battle trance</em> comes at the cost of one level of the <em>fatigued</em> bane.</p><p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 2 (1d6), Fortitude 4 (1d10), Might 5 (2d6), Will 3 (1d8), Presence 3 (1d8)<br><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 30<br><strong>Guard:</strong> 19 (20 in battle trance - Agility 2, Might 5, Chainmail 2)<br><strong>Toughness:</strong> 17 (20 in battle trance)<br><strong>Resolve:</strong> 16 (19 in battle trance)<br><strong>Speed:</strong> 30’</p><p><strong>Feats:</strong> Battle Trance, Reckless Attack</p><p><strong>Notable Equipment:</strong> Great Axe, Chainmail, Throwing Axe<br><strong>Favored Actions</strong><br><em><strong>Great Axe</strong></em> (damaging attack): Might vs. Guard, advantage 1<br><em><strong>Forceful Blow</strong></em> (inflict <em>forced move</em>): Might vs. Guard, advantage 2<br><em><strong>Devastating Blow</strong></em> (inflict <em>stunned</em>): Might vs. Toughness, advantage 2<br><em><strong>Battle Cry</strong></em> (inflict <em>fear</em>): Might vs. Resolve<br><em><strong>Foam at the Mouth</strong></em> (inflict <em>provoked</em>): Might vs. Resolve<br><em><strong>Warrior’s Chant</strong></em> (invoke <em>bolster</em>): Presence vs. 16 (PL 3)</p><h3 id="chronomage">Chronomage</h3><p>Chronomages see and manipulate the flow of the most powerful force in the universe: time. They possess the power to unravel the very fabric of the universe and rearrange it to suit their needs. Past, present, and future are all one to the Chronomage, and their preternatural connection to the fourth dimension often creates rifts between those with a more conventional understanding of time.</p><h4 id="strategy-4">Strategy</h4><p>Chronomages can both control the flow of time and see beyond its usual boundaries. Out of combat, they use this sixth sense by way of the <em>precognition</em> boon to peer into past and future events that are beyond mortal ken.</p><p>When combat ensues, the Chronomage’s control of time offers the party options. Whether the Chronomage is slowing down time to allow their companions to move with seemingly inhuman speed, speeding up the flow of time to exhaust the enemy, or reversing time to close wounds, the Chronomage is able to use their mastery over the fourth dimension to gain an advantage in any situation. They make use of the <em>boon focus</em> feat to invoke these beneficial and baleful effects in a field around them or an ally. <em>Attribute substitution</em> protects their fragile physical forms, which are neither strong nor agile outside of their powers. When enemies incur their wrath, the Chronomage hyperlapses time within a foe’s body, hastening the entropic decay of bones and flesh.</p><p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Will 2 (1d6), Creation 3 (1d8), Entropy 4 (1d10), Movement 5 (2d6), Prescience 3 (1d8)<br><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 14<br><strong>Guard:</strong> 16 (Movement 5 via <em>attribute substitution</em>, Steelsilk Armor 1)<br><strong>Toughness:</strong> 12<br><strong>Resolve:</strong> 12<br><strong>Speed:</strong> 30’</p><p><strong>Feats:</strong> Boon Focus I (Aura), Lightning Reflexes I, Attribute Substitution I (Movement &gt; Agility)</p><p><strong>Notable Equipment:</strong> Steelsilk Armor</p><p><strong>Favored Actions</strong><br><em><strong>Hyperlapse Decay</strong></em> (damaging attack): Entropy vs. Guard<br><em><strong>Stasis Field</strong></em> (invoke <em>5’ aura: immobile</em>): Auto-success at PL 1 via <em>boon focus</em><br><em><strong>Time Dilation Field</strong></em> (invoke <em>5’ aura: slowed</em>): Auto-success at PL 1 via <em>boon focus</em><br><em><strong>Fast Forward</strong></em> (invoke <em>haste</em>): Movement vs. 14 - 18 (PL 2 - 4)<br><em><strong>Mass Fast Forward</strong></em> (invoke <em>5’ aura: haste</em>): Auto-success at PL 2 via <em>boon focus</em><br><em><strong>Rewind</strong></em> (invoke <em>heal</em>): Creation vs. 12 - 16 (PL 1 - 3)<br><em><strong>Time Step</strong></em> (invoke <em>teleport</em>): Movement vs. 16 (PL 3)<br><em><strong>Futuresight</strong></em> (invoke <em>precognition</em>): Prescience vs. 12 - 16 (PL 1 - 3)</p><h3 id="courtier">Courtier</h3><p>Courtiers are career politicians who make it their life’s pursuit to be an embodiment of majestic social grace. The air of gravitas that they carry makes all who encounter them like clay in a Courtier’s hands. As a host, a courtier will often have a social gathering engineered down to the most minute detail, such that guests feel exactly as the courtier has planned for them to feel. Often they command respect with regal attire, whether a showcase of Victorian splendor, Far Eastern grace, or the sleek fashion of modern day corporate fat cats.</p><h4 id="strategy-5">Strategy</h4><p>Specialized primarily in social situations and of little help when a fight breaks out, a courtier invests most of their effort in engineering circumstances to avoid bloodshed. When that fails, they aim to ally themselves with the side heavily favored to win through the use of Deception, Persuasion, Presence, and Influence. Once the Courtier has earned the trust of a powerful acquaintance via the <em>charmed</em> bane, it’s common for the target to remain indefinitely loyal to the Courtier, thanks to the <em>potent bane</em> and <em>unending charm</em> feats.</p><p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 2 (1d6), Will 3 (1d8), Deception 4 (1d10), Presence 3 (1d8), Influence 5 (2d6)<br><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 22<br><strong>Guard:</strong> 13 (Agility 2, Steelsilk Armor 1)<br><strong>Toughness:</strong> 13<br><strong>Resolve:</strong> 16<br><strong>Speed:</strong> 30’</p><p><strong>Feats:</strong> Potent Bane (Charmed), Unending Charm</p><p><strong>Notable Equipment:</strong> Majestic Clothing, Dagger, Compact Pistol (Handgun), Steelsilk Armor</p><p><strong>Favored Actions</strong><br><em><strong>Master Conversationalist</strong></em> (inflict <em>charmed</em>): Influence vs. Resolve<br><em><strong>Scathing Insult</strong></em> (inflict <em>demoralized</em>): Influence vs. Resolve<br><em><strong>Conflicting Stories</strong></em> (inflict <em>memory alteration</em>): Influence vs. Resolve<br><em><strong>Sympathetic Ear</strong></em> (inflict <em>truthfulness</em>): Influence vs. Resolve<br><em><strong>Personal Favor</strong></em> (inflict <em>dominated</em>): Influence vs. Resolve<br><em><strong>Hidden Pistol</strong></em> (damaging attack): Agility vs. Guard</p><h3 id="druid">Druid</h3><p>Druids are defenders of nature who draw upon its power via a close bond that enables them to shapechange into many of the powerful creatures found in their natural habitats. Not all druids are attuned to the woodlands. Some of them shapeshift into aquatic species and spend long periods beneath the ocean’s surface, while others dwell as all manner of avian species in mountain ranges that pierce the clouds high above. Whatever their preferred habitat, druids are nothing if not adaptable.</p><h4 id="strategy-6">Strategy</h4><p>Being one with nature, druids tend to use natural surroundings to their advantage, whether summoning up an imposing wall of briars with the <em>barrier</em> boon, an animated vine that entwines the target with <em>immobile</em>, or hastening the healing power of nature via the <em>regeneration</em> boon. Druids also make excellent combatants and scouts. As a scout, they are able to sneak unnoticed into an enemy camp as a naturally occurring animal species. As a combatant, they can shift into a massive and powerful creature, such as a bear, to quickly deal with enemies.</p><p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 2 (1d6), Fortitude 3 (1d8), Might 2 (1d6), Perception 2 (1d6), Will 2 (1d6), Alteration 5 (2d6), Creation 3 (1d8)<br><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 20<br><strong>Guard:</strong> 17 (Agility 2, Might 2, Splint Mail 3)<br><strong>Toughness:</strong> 15<br><strong>Resolve:</strong> 12<br><strong>Speed:</strong> 25’</p><p><strong>Feats:</strong> Boon Focus II (Shapeshift)</p><p><strong>Notable Equipment:</strong> Splint Mail (treat as Full Plate), Staff, Shortspear</p><p><strong>Favored Actions</strong><br><em><strong>Shapechange</strong></em> (invoke <em>shapeshift</em>): Auto-success at PL 5 via <em>boon focus</em><br><em><strong>Ensnaring Vines</strong></em> (inflict <em>immobile</em>): Creation vs. Toughness<br><em><strong>Wall of Briars</strong></em> (invoke <em>barrier</em>): Creation vs. 16 (PL 3)<br><em><strong>Animate Plants</strong></em> (invoke <em>summon creature</em>): Alteration vs. 18 - 20 (PL 4 - 5)<br><em><strong>Regrowth</strong></em> (invoke <em>regeneration</em>): Alteration vs. 12 - 20 (PL 1 - 5)</p><h4 id="bear-form">Bear Form</h4><p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Might 5 (2d6), Agility 1 (1d4), Fortitude 3 (1d8), Perception 2 (1d6)<br><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 20<br><strong>Guard:</strong> 19 (Agility 1, Might 5, Splint Mail 3)<br><strong>Speed:</strong> 25’</p><h4 id="hawk-form">Hawk Form</h4><p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Might 1 (1d4), Agility 3 (1d8), Fortitude 1 (1d4), Perception 5 (2d6)<br><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 16<br><strong>Guard:</strong> 14 (Agility 3, Might 1)<br><strong>Speed:</strong> 30’ flying</p><h4 id="shark-form">Shark Form</h4><p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Might 4 (1d10), Agility 2 (1d6), Fortitude 3 (1d8), Perception 3 (1d8)<br><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 20<br><strong>Guard:</strong> 19 (Agility 2, Might 4, Splint Mail 3)<br><strong>Speed:</strong> 30’ swimming</p><h3 id="engineer">Engineer</h3><p>Engineers are infused with the spark of creation, and can comprehend the inner workings of extremely complex systems. While Engineers are typically dextrous and tough as nails, their real power lies in the cogwheel gadgets they whip up with ease from spare parts and salvaged goods. These hissing steam gizmos and mechanical implements ensure that the Engineer is prepared for any situation.</p><h4 id="strategy-7">Strategy</h4><p>In non-combat situations, the Engineer’s prowess comes from the versatility of their creations. Given enough time, they can use the <em>craft extraordinary item</em> feat to prepare for a wide variety of situations. Whether they are building a 100’ ladder that can collapse to the size of a backpack, a remote controlled scout bot, or a wearable automated wound closing device, the Engineer can always find a way to put their creative skills to provide the party with utility and flexibility.</p><p>In combat, Engineers adjust their strategy to the problem at hand to support their companions. The <em>bolster</em> boon can represent anything from a pair of spring loaded boots to a guided targeting helmet. When enemies are overwhelming, the Engineer uses <em>summon creature</em> to activate one or more of their combat bots. And if their fancy creations and jury-rigged gizmos aren’t doing the job, the Engineer is no slouch with a trusty old hand cannon.</p><p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 3 (1d8), Fortitude 3 (1d8), Learning 3 (1d8), Logic 3 (1d8), Perception 1 (1d4), Creation 5 (2d6)<br><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 16<br><strong>Guard:</strong> 15 (Agility 3, Kevlar Vest 2)<br><strong>Toughness:</strong> 13<br><strong>Resolve:</strong> 10<br><strong>Speed:</strong> 30’</p><p><strong>Feats:</strong> Boon Focus I (Summon Creature), Craft Extraordinary Item I</p><p><strong>Notable Equipment:</strong> Hand cannon (same as revolver), Kevlar Vest, 2 Grenades, Engineering Tools</p><p><strong>Favored Actions</strong><br><em><strong>Hand Cannon</strong></em> (damaging attack): Agility vs. Guard<br><em><strong>Grenade</strong></em> (damaging attack, 10’ cube): Agility vs. Guard<br><em><strong>Leg Shot</strong></em> (inflict <em>slowed</em>): Agility vs. Guard, advantage 1<br><em><strong>Reinforcements!</strong></em> (invoke <em>summon creature</em>): Auto-success at PL 5 via <em>boon focus</em><br><em><strong>Gadgets &amp; Gizmos</strong></em> (invoke <em>bolster</em>): Creation vs. 16 (PL 3)<br><em><strong>Jerry Rig</strong></em> (invoke <em>genesis</em>): Creation vs. 12 - 20 (PL 1 - 5)<br><em><strong>Cauterize Wounds</strong></em> (invoke <em>heal</em>): Creation vs. 12 - 20 (PL 1 - 5)</p><h3 id="gunslinger">Gunslinger</h3><p>Some are lawmen who serve as judge, jury, and executioner. Others are bounty hunters trying to earn enough cash to pay off an old debt. Still others are mercenaries who shoot for the highest bidder. Whatever their motivation, all Gunslingers invoke fear from any fool unfortunate enough to end up on the wrong end of their barrel.</p><h4 id="strategy-8">Strategy</h4><p>Gunslingers do more than just hurl lead. Their prowess in ranged combat is fueled by entropic energy gained from otherworldly powers, either purchased through diabolical pacts or earned through prowess of mind and spirit. Out of combat, Gunslingers are perceptive and intimidating, and they can overawe lesser folk with ease. While many Gunslingers are loners bent solely on achieving their mission, those who step up to the occasion make excellent leaders to pull a ragtag posse together into a cohesive unit.</p><p>When a fight breaks out, Gunslingers keep their distance and use their dual revolvers to rain hell down upon their foes. When damage alone isn’t getting the job done, Gunslingers can aim their shots to hinder enemies in all manner of ways: shooting their weapons out of their hands, knocking the wind out of them, or blowing off a toe. The <em>multi-attack specialist</em> feat allows them to shoot twice as fast as a lesser gunfighter, enabling them to take on large groups of foes single-handedly. Supplementing their marksmanship with dark powers, they invoke banes and boons with Entropy. Favorites include invoking <em>life drain</em> to heal a little bit with every shot and afflicting enemies with the <em>sickened</em> bane to render their attacks nearly useless. When foes close in, a Gunslinger doesn’t hesitate to use Entropy to create a defensive <em>aura</em> or scare enemies away with <em>fear</em>.</p><p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 5 (2d6), Perception 3 (1d8), Will 2 (1d6), Presence 3 (1d8), Entropy 4 (1d10)<br><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 20<br><strong>Guard:</strong> 17 (Agility 5, Heavy Trench Coat 2)<br><strong>Toughness:</strong> 15<br><strong>Resolve:</strong> 16<br><strong>Speed:</strong> 30’</p><p><strong>Feats:</strong> Multi-Attack Specialist II</p><p><strong>Notable Equipment:</strong> Heavy Trench Coat (treat as Kevlar Vest), 2 Revolvers, Rifle</p><p><strong>Favored Actions</strong><br><em><strong>Two-Gun Assault</strong></em> (focus action, damaging attack, 2 attacks): Agility vs. Guard<br><em><strong>Fan the Hammer</strong></em> (focus action, damaging attack, 3 attacks): Agility vs. Guard, disadvantage 3<br><em><strong>Bounty’s Curse</strong></em> (inflict <em>stunned</em>): Entropy vs. Toughness<br><em><strong>Toe Shot</strong></em> (inflict <em>slowed</em>): Agility vs. Guard. advantage 1<br><em><strong>Hand Shot</strong></em> (inflict <em>disarmed</em>): Agility vs. Guard, advantage 1<br><em><strong>Rifle</strong></em> (damaging attack): Agility vs. Guard<br><em><strong>Darkblast Shot</strong></em> (inflict <em>sickened</em>): Entropy vs. Toughness<br><em><strong>Baleful Shadow</strong></em> (invoke 5’ <em>aura: persistent damage</em>): Entropy vs. 18 (PL 4)<br><em><strong>Soul Syphon</strong></em> (invoke <em>life drain</em>): Entropy vs. 20 (PL 5)<br><em><strong>Unnerving Gaze</strong></em> (inflict <em>fear</em>): Entropy vs. Resolve</p><h3 id="hacker">Hacker</h3><p>Knowledge is power, as the saying goes, and the Hacker is a testament to the fact that nearly anyone can be taken down with the right information. Some Hackers are mercenaries that work for the highest bidder, primarily in the game for the adrenaline rush and the thrill of controlling massive amounts of data and the fates of those who depend on it. Others rally behind a larger cause with intent of changing the world for better or worse.</p><h4 id="strategy-9">Strategy</h4><p>The Hacker is a master of data and information. Above all, they seek to gather information and harness its power. Hackers use information to piece together secrets and data which others assume is secured beyond access. Out of combat, the Hacker uses banes and boons such as <em>seeing</em> via their drone and <em>spying</em> or <em>precognition</em> to track information or persons of interest through databases, servers, surveillance cameras, credit card records, and and other sources of poorly secured or encrypted data. If deception is called for, Hackers tap into the almost omni-present streams of data of systems distributed throughout the world to fabricate video feeds, holograms, or audio transmissions using the <em>phantasm</em> bane.</p><p>When combat breaks out, Hackers tend to avoid the front lines, relying on their drones to do the fighting for them. From a secure vantage point, the Hacker pilots the multi-purpose drone using a tablet or similar device, using its mounted laser cannon to hold enemies back. In addition to drone combat, Hackers also assist allies with the <em>bolster</em> boon through illicit data and hacking nearby systems to gain an edge.</p><p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Logic 4 (1d10), Will 3 (1d8), Perception 2 (1d6), Influence 3 (1d8), Prescience 5 (2d6)<br><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 16<br><strong>Guard:</strong> 10<br><strong>Toughness:</strong> 13<br><strong>Resolve:</strong> 13<br><strong>Speed:</strong> 30’</p><p><strong>Feats:</strong> Companion I (Drone), Bane Focus (Spying), Untrackable</p><p><strong>Notable Equipment:</strong> Tablet, Laptop, VR Goggles</p><p><strong>Favored Actions</strong><br><em><strong>Dark Web Insight</strong></em> (invoke <em>bolster</em>): Prescience vs. 16 (PL 3)<br><em><strong>Algorithmic Prediction</strong></em> (invoke <em>precognition</em>): Prescience vs. 12 - 20 (PL 1 - 5)<br><em><strong>Multivariate Sensor Sweep</strong></em> (invoke <em>truesight</em>): Prescience vs. 20 (PL 5)<br><em><strong>IoT Zombie Network</strong></em> (inflict <em>spying</em>): Prescience vs. Resolve, advantage 2<br><em><strong>Hologram Projection</strong></em> (inflict <em>phantasm</em>): Influence vs. Resolve<br><em><strong>Neural Rewiring</strong></em> (inflict <em>charmed</em>): Influence vs. Resolve</p><h4 id="drone-companion">Drone Companion</h4><p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 3 (1d8), Fortitude 1 (1d4), Logic 1 (1d4), Perception 2 (1d6), Will 2 (1d6), Energy 4 (1d10)<br><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 16<br><strong>Guard:</strong> 13 (Agility 3)<br><strong>Toughness:</strong> 13<br><strong>Resolve:</strong> 12<br><strong>Speed:</strong> 30’</p><p><strong>Feats:</strong> none</p><p><strong>Favored Actions</strong><br><em><strong>Laser</strong></em> (damaging attack): Energy vs. Guard<br><em><strong>Stun Ray</strong></em> (inflict <em>immobile</em>): Energy vs. Toughness</p><h3 id="mystic">Mystic</h3><p>Mystics are typically found far removed from the hustle and bustle of the city and detached from the advances of the society they left behind.

Also gifted with magics of healing and protection, the Ningyozukai only call on the Yoroi armor when a situation call for force of arms or brute strength.</p><h4 id="strategy-11">Strategy</h4><p>The Ningyozukai make use of the <em>alternate form</em> feat in order to provide two distinct character options that may be swapped as needed. In their normal form, they are physically frail sorcerers who offer support to the party through boons such as <em>resistance, heal,</em> and <em>bolster</em>. In combat, their only means of inflicting damage is by using <em>summon creature</em> to call forth minor guardian spirits.</p><p>When the situation calls for it, the sorcerer will animate their Yoroi armor, which serves as an indestructible melee warrior. The Yoroi form has very high defenses and hit points, and its Might score of 5 combined with a two-handed naginata ensures that it will deal out significant damage while also manipulating the battlefield with banes such as <em>knockdown, forced move,</em> and <em>immobile</em>. In particularly difficult fights, the Yoroi enters a <em>battle trance</em>, gaining even stronger defenses and better attack prowess.</p><p>Although the Ningyozukai make use of the <em>alternate form</em> feat, they do not actually physically transform when switching between sorcerer or Yoroi forms. Rather, the Yoroi armor, possessed by the sorcerer’s spirit, surrounds its frail master to encase and protect. Activating the <em>alternate form</em> feat represents the sorcerer focusing all of their will on possessing the Yoroi to make full use of its offensive powers. Thus, the Ningyozukai can only utilize actions and attributes from one of its forms at any time.</p><h4 id="sorcerer-form">Sorcerer Form</h4><p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 1 (1d4), Learning 3 (1d8), Perception 1 (1d4), Will 3 (1d8), Persuasion 3 (1d8), Creation 4 (1d10), Protection 4 (1d10)<br><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 16<br><strong>Guard:</strong> 11 (Agility 1)<br><strong>Toughness:</strong> 13<br><strong>Resolve:</strong> 13<br><strong>Speed:</strong> 30’</p><p><strong>Feats:</strong> Alternate Form II</p><p><strong>Notable Equipment:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Favored Actions</strong><br><em><strong>Spirit Guide</strong></em> (invoke <em>bolster</em>): Creation vs. 16 (PL 3)<br><em><strong>Spirit Guardian</strong></em> (invoke <em>summon creature</em>): Creation vs. 18 (PL 4)<br><em><strong>Circle of Wonder</strong></em> (invoke 5’ <em>aura: immobile</em>): Creation vs. 18 (PL 4)<br><em><strong>Ward of Protection</strong></em> (invoke <em>resistance</em>): Protection vs. 16 (PL 3)<br><em><strong>Healing Word</strong></em> (invoke <em>heal</em>): Creation vs. 12 - 18 (PL 1 - 4)</p><h4 id="yoroi-armor-form">Yoroi Armor Form</h4><p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 3 (1d8), Fortitude 4 (1d10), Might 5 (2d6), Will 2 (1d6), Presence 3 (1d8)<br><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 28<br><strong>Guard:</strong> 21 (Might 5, Agility 3, Yoroi Armor 3)<br><strong>Toughness:</strong> 16 (19 in <em>battle trance</em>)<br><strong>Resolve:</strong> 15 (18 in <em>battle trance</em>)<br><strong>Speed:</strong> 25’</p><p><strong>Feats:</strong> Battle Trance</p><p><strong>Notable Equipment:</strong> Yoroi Armor, Naginata, 3 Javelins</p><p><strong>Favored Actions</strong><br><em><strong>Naginata</strong></em> (damaging attack): Might vs. Guard, advantage 1<br><em><strong>Fang and Claw</strong></em> (damaging attack, 2 targets): Might vs. Guard, disadvantage 1<br><em><strong>Javelin</strong></em> (damaging attack): Might vs. Guard<br><em><strong>Sweeping Strike</strong></em> (inflict <em>knockdown</em>): Might vs. Guard, advantage 2<br><em><strong>Naginata Snatch</strong></em> (inflict <em>forced move</em>): Might vs. Guard, advantage 2<br><em><strong>Scorpion’s Sting</strong></em> (inflict <em>immobile</em>): Might vs. Guard, advantage 2<br><em><strong>Show of Strength</strong></em> (inflict <em>fear</em>): Might vs. Resolve<br><em><strong>Battle Command</strong></em> (invoke: <em>heal</em>): Presence vs. 12 - 16 (PL 1 - 3)</p><h3 id="ranger">Ranger</h3><p>Rangers are folk of the wilderness, hunters, and animal tamers.

Their exceptional Perception score also means that the Ranger will be the eyes of the party: locating traps, scouting for enemies, and revealing hidden passages. Their extraordinary ability to climb allows them to access paths that might be unreachable by their allies.</p><p>When combat breaks out, the Ranger typically fights in a coordinated effort with their animal companion. In melee, the wolf will attempt to inflict <em>knockdown</em> upon foes, allowing its master to strike with advantage 1 on prone enemies. When not striking for direct damage, Rangers disarm foes or whittle away at them with <em>persistent damage</em>. To keep a distance from the enemy, Rangers take to the trees to use their longbow while their wolf uses <em>immobile</em> to make the target an easy shot.</p><p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 4 (1d10), Fortitude 3 (1d8), Might 2 (1d6), Learning 2 (1d6), Perception 5 (2d6), Will 2 (1d6)<br><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 20<br><strong>Guard:</strong> 18 (Agility 4, Might 2, Chainmail 2)<br><strong>Toughness:</strong> 15<br><strong>Resolve:</strong> 12<br><strong>Speed:</strong> 35’</p><p><strong>Feats:</strong> Fleet of Foot I, Master Tracker, Climbing, Companion I</p><p><strong>Notable Equipment:</strong> Longsword, Dagger, Longbow, Chainmail</p><p><strong>Favored Actions</strong><br><em><strong>Longsword + Dagger</strong></em> (damaging attack): Agility vs. Guard, advantage 1<br><em><strong>Wounding Strike</strong></em> (inflict <em>persistent damage</em>): Agility vs. Guard, advantage 2<br><em><strong>Artful Parry</strong></em> (inflict <em>disarmed</em>): Agility vs. Guard, advantage 2<br><em><strong>Longbow</strong></em> (damaging attack): Agility vs. Guard<br><em><strong>Foot Shot</strong></em> (inflict <em>slowed</em>): Agility vs. Guard, advantage 1</p><h4 id="wolf-companion">Wolf Companion</h4><p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 4 (1d10), Fortitude 2 (1d6), Might 2 (1d6), Perception 3 (1d8), Will 1 (1d4), Presence 1 (1d4)<br><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 18<br><strong>Guard:</strong> 16 (Agility 4, Might 2)<br><strong>Toughness:</strong> 13<br><strong>Resolve:</strong> 12<br><strong>Speed:</strong> 30’</p><p><strong>Feats:</strong> none</p><p><strong>Favored Actions</strong><br><em><strong>Bite</strong></em> (damaging attack): Agility vs. Guard<br><em><strong>Takedown</strong></em> (inflict <em>knockdown</em>): Agility vs. Guard</p><h3 id="shade">Shade</h3><p>Shades are highly trained assassins that draw upon unearthly power drawn from the in-between, the void of shadows where most mortals dare not travel.

These night hunters are trained to slay from a distance—unseen, unheard, and without a trace.</p><h4 id="strategy-13">Strategy</h4><p>While Shades are trained for the specific task of neutralizing threats, their ability to manipulate shadows provides them with exceptional utility. Out of combat, they make excellent scouts, capable of hiding weapons in the extradimensional void with <em>absorb object</em>. Their ability to pass through the void makes them peerless at infiltration. When <em>teleporting</em>, even a titanium vault or door is no obstacle for a Shade as they step through the void or dematerialize into a cloud of inky entropy and slip beneath a door.</p><p>Shades prefer to remain hidden as much as possible so that when combat ensues they can catch their foes off guard. They fire their silenced sniper rifles from cover, and quickly <em>teleport</em> to a new location before they are discovered. On rare occasions where they are spotted, they use <em>haste</em> to make a fast getaway or blanket an area in <em>darkness</em> and slip away unseen.</p><p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 4, Perception 3, Will 2, Entropy 3, Movement 5<br><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 14<br><strong>Guard:</strong> 15 (Agility 4, Trenchcoat 1)<br><strong>Toughness:</strong> 12<br><strong>Resolve:</strong> 12<br><strong>Speed:</strong> 30’</p><p><strong>Feats:</strong> Boon Focus I (Teleport), Lethal Strike I</p><p><strong>Notable Equipment:</strong> Sniper Rifle, Submachine Gun, Handgun, Knife, Trench Coat (treat as Leather Armor)</p><p><strong>Favored Actions</strong><br><em><strong>Hidden Shot</strong></em> (damaging attack): Agility vs. Guard, advantage 1 if target is unaware or engaging your ally<br><em><strong>Rifle</strong></em> (damaging attack): Agility vs. Guard<br><em><strong>Tranquilizer Round</strong></em> (inflict <em>incapacitated</em>): Agility vs. Toughness<br><em><strong>Leg Shot</strong></em> (inflict <em>slowed</em>): Agility vs. Guard, advantage 1<br><em><strong>Submachine Gun</strong></em> (damaging attack, 10’ cube): Agility vs. Guard<br><em><strong>Void Step</strong></em> (invoke <em>teleport</em>): Auto-success at PL 5 via <em>boon focus</em><br><em><strong>Veil of Shadows</strong></em> (invoke <em>darkness</em>): Entropy vs. 12 - 16 (PL 1 - 3)<br><em><strong>Shadow Dodge</strong></em> (invoke <em>resistance</em>): Movement vs. 16 (PL 3)<br><em><strong>Extraplanar Pocket</strong></em> (invoke <em>absorb object</em>): Movement vs. 18 (PL 4)</p><h3 id="spellsword">Spellsword</h3><p>Equally skilled with a blade as they are with sorcery, Spellswords weave magic and martial prowess together into a powerful combination. Whether they are setting foes ablaze with a flaming sword, summoning barriers of force to deflect attacks, or outmaneuvering foes with teleportation, Spellswords control the battlefield with unrivaled magic.</p><h4 id="strategy-14">Strategy</h4><p>The Spellsword is a master of versatility. Although they shine the most in the heat of battle, Spellswords can also make use of Protection and Movement attributes to provide utility to overcome many obstacles.</p><p>Within combat, the Spellsword’s <em>attribute substitution</em> feat allows them to use their Energy score for weapon attacks, and their trio of extraordinary attributes provides them with access to a versatile selection of banes and boons. <em>Lightning reflexes</em> ensures that they will often act early in combat, and Spellswords will use this opportunity to invoke the <em>resistance</em> boon or inflict a vulnerable target with <em>persistent damage</em>. Once combat is underway, Spellswords focus on finishing off damaged foes so that they can use <em>combat momentum</em> to maneuver around the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Fortitude 3 (1d8), Presence 1 (1d4), Perception 2 (1d6), Will 2 (1d6), Energy 5 (2d6), Protection 3 (1d8), Movement 3 (1d8)<br><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 22<br><strong>Guard:</strong> 17 (Energy 5 via <em>attribute substitution</em>, Chainmail 2)<br><strong>Toughness:</strong> 15<br><strong>Resolve:</strong> 13<br><strong>Speed:</strong> 30’</p><p><strong>Feats:</strong> Attribute Substitution II (Energy &gt; Agility), Combat Momentum, Lightning Reflexes I</p><p><strong>Notable Equipment:</strong> Chainmail, Falchion</p><p><strong>Favored Actions</strong><br><em><strong>Falchion</strong></em> (damaging attack): Energy vs. Guard, advantage 1<br><em><strong>Enflame</strong></em> (inflict <em>persistent damage</em>): Energy vs. Guard (advantage 1 if using falchion)<br><em><strong>Disabling Strike</strong></em> (inflict <em>stunned</em>): Energy vs. Toughness<br><em><strong>Wall of Fire</strong></em> (invoke <em>barrier, 10’ line</em>): Energy vs. 16 - 20 (PL 1 - 5), disadvantage 1<br><em><strong>Smoke Step</strong></em> (invoke <em>teleport</em>): Movement vs. 16 (PL 3)<br><em><strong>Shield of Force</strong></em> (invoke <em>resistance</em>): Protection vs. 16 (PL 3)</p><h3 id="void-templar">Void Templar</h3><p>An ancient order of warrior-mages, the Void Templars undergo over a decade of training before they are even permitted their first attempt at the rigorous test which initiates them as full Templars. A deadly mix of soldier and void wielder, they form a heavily armored support unit trained to keep other soldiers out of harm’s way. Their highly coveted guardian armor amplifies their control of the void, supercharging their power to nullify enemy attacks.</p><h4 id="strategy-15">Strategy</h4><p>Void Templars are built to defend, wielding power from the void that swallows up attacks from lasers, magic, and all manner of attacks. Using their exceptionally high Energy attribute, the Templars can call upon the void to nullify almost any attack. Although their heavy armor makes them slower than the standard soldier, they can <em>teleport</em> or even invoke <em>aura: haste</em> to speed up themselves and their comrades. Also, <em>teleport</em> allows them to access areas and bypass obstacles that others might struggle with.</p><p>Within combat, a Templar’s primary duty is to keep their allies alive. They make extensive use of the defend action by deploying all manner of countermeasures from their Templar Armor, such as laser netting, or the onboard micro missiles to intercept incoming projectiles. Their <em>battlefield retribution</em> feat allows the Templar to turn these defensive actions against the attacker. In addition to these countermeasures, Templars also reshape the battlefield and force enemies into tough decisions with banes and boons such as <em>forced move, barrier,</em> and <em>immobile.</em></p><p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 2 (1d6), Fortitude 3 (1d8), Will 2 (1d6), Presence 2 (1d6), Energy 5 (2d6), Movement 4 (1d10)<br><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 24<br><strong>Guard:</strong> 15 (16 with shield - Agility 2, Templar Armor 3)<br><strong>Toughness:</strong> 15<br><strong>Resolve:</strong> 14<br><strong>Speed:</strong> 25’</p><p><strong>Feats:</strong> Defensive Reflexes I, Battlefield Retribution I, Sentinel I</p><p><strong>Notable Equipment:</strong> Combat Shield, Pistol, Templar Armor (treat as Full Plate), 1 Grenade</p><p><strong>Favored Actions</strong><br><em><strong>Void Nullification</strong></em> (defend action): Energy vs. target’s attack roll, advantage 1<br><em><strong>Void Matrix</strong></em> (invoke 10’ line <em>barrier</em>): Energy vs. 16 - 20 (PL 3 - 5)<br><em><strong>Quickening Aura</strong></em> (invoke <em>aura: haste</em>): Movement vs. 18 (PL 4)<br><em><strong>Force Push</strong></em> (inflict <em>forced move</em>): Movement vs. Guard<br><em><strong>Paralysis Beam</strong></em> (inflict <em>immobile</em>): Movement vs. Guard<br><em><strong>Telekinesis</strong></em> (invoke: <em>telekinesis</em>): Movement vs. 16 (PL 3)<br><em><strong>Suppression Field</strong></em> (invoke 5’ <em>aura: forced move</em>): Energy vs. 18 (PL 4)</p><h2 id="gaining-xp-and-leveling-up">Gaining XP and Leveling Up</h2><p>As the legend you are creating unfolds and grows in danger and magnitude, your character’s power will grow to match the challenge. This power comes in the form of experience points (or XP), which are rewarded by the GM and allow you to advance in level and gain access to new feats, attributes, banes, and boons.</p><p>Your total XP earned determines your level, with every 3 XP allowing you to advance to the next level.

If you want your character to be able to take more hits, increase either your Fortitude, Presence, or Will attribute.

Other times, the GM may decide to run a campaign with PCs who have already accumulated some wealth and power. In situations like these, you can use the Characters Beyond First Level table to determine attribute points, feat points, and wealth for PCs.
