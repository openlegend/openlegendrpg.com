Feats are used to define your character’s specializations–the actions, tasks, and abilities they excel at beyond all others. Some feats will enhance your major actions, such as by allowing you to multi-attack with reduced disadvantage, while others will grant you completely new powers, such as the ability to change your shape.</p><h2 id="acquiring-feats">Acquiring Feats</h2><p>During your adventurers, the GM will award you Experience Points (or XP) for accomplishing quests and driving the story forward. Every time you gain a point of XP, you also gain one feat point that can be used to purchase new feats just as you did during character creation. You do not have to spend these feat points when you gain them. You can feel free to save any unused feat points to be used at a later time.</p><h2 id="reading-a-feat-description">Reading a Feat Description</h2><p>Each feat description includes the following elements.</p><p><strong>Title.</strong> The name of the feat. Some feats contain multiple tiers, rising in power with each new tier. If a feat contains multiple tiers, these will be indicated in parentheses after the title (e.g., “Alternate Form (I - II)”).</p><p><strong>Cost.</strong> This is the number of feat points required to purchase the feat. If the feat has multiple tiers, the cost is the same for each tier and must be paid every time the feat is purchased at a new tier <em>unless otherwise noted in the feat description</em>. So, to access the Tier 5 ability of a feat, you must pay for the feat 5 times. If a feat does not have a noted exception it can only be purchased once.</p><p><strong>Prerequisites.</strong> Many feats have specific requirements that must be met before a character can purchase the feat. Prerequisites may take the form of a minimum attribute score, another feat, or a special requirement. If a feat has multiple tiers with different prerequisites, the requirements for each tier are separated by a slash.</p><p><strong>Description.</strong> This entry simply provides a general idea of what the feat could look like in the story. Because feats generally provide mechanical benefits that aren’t tied to specific sources, you can interpret the look and feel of your feat in a way that best fits your character concept and campaign setting. For example, a paladin in a typical fantasy setting might use the <em>companion</em> feat to enlist the assistance of a noble squire, while a technologist in a futuristic campaign might use the same feat to create an automaton combat droid. In both cases, the feat functions the same even though it is described differently.</p><p><strong>Effect.</strong> This entry indicates the mechanical effects of the feat on the rules of the game.</p><pre><code></code></pre><h2 id="feat-list">Feat List</h2><div class="hr"></div><hr><h3 id="alternate-form-i---ii">Alternate Form (I - II)</h3><div class="feat-entry"></div><hr><ul><li><strong>Cost:</strong> 3 points</li><li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></li><li><strong>Tier 1 - 2:</strong> None</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> You have the ability to transform from one persona to another, whether that be through bodily transformation like a werewolf or through exterior mechanisms, such as a cybernetically enhanced soldier who can call forth a symbiotic mech suit.</li><li><p><strong>Effect:</strong> Upon taking this feat, you build a single alternate form using the normal character creation rules, though your attribute and feat points are determined by your tier in this feat:</p></li><li><strong>Tier 1</strong> - Half of your primary form’s attribute points (rounded up), and 3 feat points.</li><li><p><strong>Tier 2</strong> - Same attribute points as your primary form, and 3 feat points less than your primary form.</p></li></ul><p>Whenever your primary form gains new attribute points or levels up, your alternate form also gains points according to the above formulas.</p><p>As a focus action, you may change between any two forms (including your primary form or any alternate form). You maintain this capability in all of your forms.</p><p>Each form is treated as a completely different character for mechanical purposes - possessing different attributes, feats, perks, flaws, and other defining characteristics. Your alternate form does, however, retain the ability to transform back into your primary form.</p><p>In order to keep track of hit points, you should always record the total damage that your character has suffered. When transforming, your damage remains with you even if your maximum hit points change. For example, Dr. Jekyll has a max HP of 15 and Mr. Hyde has a max HP of 30. During combat, Mr. Hyde suffers 10 damage. When he later transforms back into Dr. Jekyll, the 10 damage remains and is subtracted from his new maximum, leaving the doctor with 5 out of 15 hit points. Additionally, when changing forms, if your hit points would be reduced to less than 1, your hit point total becomes 1 instead. - <strong>Special:</strong> When selecting feats for your alternate form, you may not select the <em>Alternate Form</em> feat.</p><p>With GM approval, you may take this feat multiple times. If you do, you get access to an additional form. Multiple Alternate Forms can be a powerful way of accumulating new feat points and attributes. The GM should prevent players from exploiting the feat to create an overly powerful character.</p><div class="footnote">CHAPTER 3: FEATS</div><h3 id="area-manipulation-i---v">Area Manipulation (I - V)</h3><div class="feat-entry"></div><hr><ul><li><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 point</li><li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></li><li><strong>Tier 1 - 5:</strong> None</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> Whether unloading your assault rifle on full-automatic or hurling a ball of flame, you are exceptionally precise at choosing targets for area attacks, allowing you to avoid allies who would otherwise be caught in the line of fire.</li><li><strong>Effect:</strong> For each tier of this feat you possess, you can omit a single 5-foot square from being targeted as part of an area attack.</li></ul><h3 id="armor-mastery-i---ii">Armor Mastery (I - II)</h3><div class="feat-entry"></div><hr><ul><li><strong>Cost:</strong> 3 points</li><li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></li><li><strong>Tier 1 - 2:</strong> None</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> Whether you are a heavily armored mechanized knight or a nimble rogue in studded leather, you and your armor are one.

Whether using fancy footwork, magical force, or tactical superiority, you know how to force your enemy to attack unintended targets.</li><li><strong>Effect:</strong> When you make a defend action and your roll exceeds the attacker’s action roll, you can choose to redirect the attack to a target that is neither you, nor the attacker. The original attack roll does not change, only the target. If the attack was a melee attack, you can redirect it to anyone within 5’ of you (as opposed to within 5’ of the attacker).</li></ul><h3 id="attack-specialization-i---ix">Attack Specialization (I - IX)</h3><div class="feat-entry"></div><hr><ul><li><strong>Cost:</strong> 3 points</li><li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></li><li><strong>Tier 1 - 3:</strong> Agility 3, Might 3, or Any Extraordinary 3</li><li><strong>Tier 4 - 6:</strong> Agility 5, Might 5, or Any Extraordinary 5</li><li><strong>Tier 7 - 9:</strong> Agility 7, Might 7, or Any Extraordinary 7</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> Like a samurai who masters the art of the katana or an elementalist who specializes in summoning flame, you are so well trained with a particular form of attack that you can devastate foes with much more skill than the average combatant.</li><li><strong>Effect:</strong> When you take this feat, select one weapon or attack type. You gain advantage 1 per tier of this feat for any <em>damaging</em> attack made with your chosen attack type. This bonus does not apply to bane attacks or boon invocations. Examples of attack types you can choose to specialize in include fire, cold, lightning, acid, poison, entropy, creation, and force - though this list is not exhaustive.</li><li><strong>Special:</strong> In addition to purchasing multiple tiers of this feat, you may take this feat multiple times and select a new weapon or attack type each time. Your total advantage to an attack is equal to your tier for that particular weapon or attack type. For example, a character might have Attack Specialization II (Fire) for fire attacks and Attack Specialization IV (Long Sword) for long sword attacks.</li></ul><h3 id="attribute-substitution-i---ii">Attribute Substitution (I - II)</h3><div class="feat-entry"></div><hr><ul><li><strong>Cost:</strong> 2 points</li><li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></li><li><strong>Tier 1 - 2:</strong> None</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> Your prowess in an extraordinary, mental, or social attribute is linked in a way that empowers another attribute of your character, allowing you to use that attribute for tasks normally reserved for another. Examples of Attribute Substitution in play include a martial artist who is physically weak but capable of using internal chi to throw and disable opponents, an anatomical genius who uses logic to make vital strikes rather than their agility, or a gunslinger whose deadshot aim is the result of a dark pact.</li><li><strong>Effect:</strong> When you take this feat, you create a permanent link between two attributes: one stronger (the primary attribute) and one weaker (the dependent attribute). You may use your primary attribute in place of the dependent attribute for different purposes depending on which tier of the feat you have:</li><li><strong>Tier 1</strong> ___</li><li>Making non-attack, non-invocation action rolls</li><li>Calculating hit points, defenses, and other secondary statistics</li><li>Meeting feat prerequisites</li><li>Other situations at the GM’s discretion</li><li><strong>Tier 2</strong> ___</li><li>Making attack action rolls</li><li>Invoking banes and boons</li></ul><p>The relationship formed by your two attributes is subject to case-by-case approval and must be approved by the GM first. The link must be logical and consistent with the story you are trying to tell. For example, a brawler who substitutes their Logic for their Might to represent their ability to use leverage in grappling rather than strength would likely not get to use their Logic score for an attempt to bend the bars on a prison cell.</p><div class="footnote">CHAPTER 3: FEATS</div><p>Furthermore, the GM should prevent players from creating illogical substitutions that are purely aimed at making their characters unreasonably powerful. Two examples of proper uses of this feat include a calculating warrior who studies angles, leverage, and physics to substitute Logic for Might, or a gunslinger who channels dark energy, giving her deadshot accuracy and substituting Entropy for Agility. ___</p><h3 id="bane-focus">Bane Focus</h3><div class="feat-entry"></div><hr><ul><li><strong>Cost:</strong> 3 points</li><li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></li><li><strong>Tier 1:</strong> Ability to invoke the chosen bane</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> You are specialized in the use of a particular bane that is iconic to your character. Perhaps you are a martial artist known for your stunning strikes, a sniper who knows how to slow a target’s escape, or a fire mage who sets enemies ablaze with persistent burning damage.</li><li><strong>Effect:</strong> Choose a bane that you can invoke. When your roll on a damaging attack exceeds the target’s defense by 5 or more (as opposed to the usual 10), you can inflict this bane for free. Each attack is still only capable of inflicting a single bane. Furthermore, when making a bane attack to inflict your chosen bane, you gain advantage 2 on the bane attack roll.</li></ul><p><strong>Special:</strong> You may take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, choose a different bane.</p><h3 id="battle-trance">Battle Trance</h3><div class="feat-entry"></div><hr><ul><li><strong>Cost:</strong> 3 points</li><li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></li><li><strong>Tier 1:</strong> Fortitude 3 or Will 3</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> You can enter a heightened mental state of combat readiness, in which your body is strengthened and your mind transcends fear and pain. Examples include a raging barbarian or an unstoppable samurai with laser focus in the heat of battle.</li><li><strong>Effect:</strong> As a free action on your turn, you may enter a battle trance. While entranced, you have advantage 1 on all attacks. Additionally, your Toughness and Resolve defenses are increased by 3. If your total armor bonus is less than 3, it becomes 3. If you take three consecutive turns without making an attack roll against an enemy creature, the battle trance ends. When the battle trance ends, you automatically suffer 1 level of the <em>fatigued</em> bane.</li></ul><h3 id="battlefield-opportunist-i---v">Battlefield Opportunist (I - V)</h3><div class="feat-entry"></div><hr><ul><li><strong>Cost:</strong> 2 points</li><li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></li><li><strong>Tier 1 - 5:</strong> Agility 4 or Might 4</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> Your battlefield prowess allows you to capitalize on windows of opportunity that others don’t notice, making you far more deadly in melee combat. Whether you wield an axe, plasmablade, or your bare fists, foes struggle to maneuver around or away from you.</li><li><strong>Effect:</strong> You may make an additional opportunity attack per round for each tier of this feat you possess. You can only make one opportunity attack per triggering action (e.g., you cannot make multiple attacks against the same foe when they leave your threatened space).</li></ul><h3 id="battlefield-punisher">Battlefield Punisher</h3><div class="feat-entry"></div><hr><ul><li><strong>Cost:</strong> 3 points</li><li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></li><li><strong>Tier 1:</strong></li><li>Agility 5, Might 5, or any Extraordinary 5</li><li>Battlefield Reflexes</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> Not only are your battle reflexes uncanny, but you can devastate your opponents with a signature secondary effect. Examples of this feat in action include a stalwart paladin who knocks foes prone, a ninja who blinds enemies, or a telekinetic psychic who hurls attacks away.</li><li><strong>Effect:</strong> Choose a bane you can inflict. Any time you use the defend action with an attribute that could inflict the chosen bane and deal 10 damage via the Battlefield Reflexes feat, you may choose to automatically afflict the attacker with the chosen bane.</li></ul><h3 id="battlefield-reflexes">Battlefield Reflexes</h3><div class="feat-entry"></div><hr><ul><li><strong>Cost:</strong> 2 points</li><li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></li><li><strong>Tier 1:</strong> Agility 4, Might 4, or any Extraordinary 4</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> You are a master of the counter attack. This might take the form of deftly redirecting a strike back upon the attacker or simply capitalizing on holes in your foe’s guard when they are in the midst of an attack. Your prowess on the battlefield allows you to not only intercept attacks but also decimate foes with your retaliatory strikes.</li><li><strong>Effect:</strong> When you use the defend interrupt action, you also deal damage to the attacker equal to the amount by which your action roll exceeds the attacker’s roll.</li></ul><h3 id="boon-access">Boon Access</h3><div class="feat-entry"></div><hr><ul><li><strong>Cost:</strong> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 points</li><li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></li><li><strong>Tier 1:</strong> None</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> You have a special gift: it might be the result of your heritage, a close encounter with magical energy, or the result of years of training with a master. In any case, although you do not necessarily possess the aptitude to work extraordinary powers for yourself or create a desired effect with your physical capabilities alone, you are able to reliably replicate a single boon.</li><li><strong>Effect:</strong> When you choose this feat, choose one boon that you do not have the requisite attribute to invoke. The cost of this feat is equal to the power level of the chosen boon. You can invoke the chosen boon despite lacking the necessary attribute. For invocation rolls, treat your attribute score as the power level of the boon. If the boons has multiple attribute prerequisite options, you choose one attribute when you take this feat. Additionally,</li></ul><div class="footnote">CHAPTER 3: FEATS</div><div class="feat-entry"></div><hr><ul><li></li><li></li><li>you count as having access to the chosen boon for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisites, and your attribute for meeting such prerequisites is equal to the power level of the boon. The Boon Access feat bypasses the normal attribute score restrictions based on character level, so a first level character could spend all 6 of their feat points to begin play with access to a power level 6 boon. You may acquire this feat multiple times. Each time, select a new boon.</li><li><strong>Special:</strong> You may take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, choose a new boon to gain access to.</li></ul><p>Note that this feat can give access to high-powered boons with a potential for very dramatic impact on the storyline of a game. As such, using this feat to access a boon of power level 6 or higher should be approved by the GM before using it in a game.</p><p>If you ever meet the attribute prerequisite for the chosen boon, you may choose at that time to lose this feat and regain the feat points spent. Re-allocate them as you choose.</p><h3 id="boon-focus-i---iii">Boon Focus (I - III)</h3><div class="feat-entry"></div><hr><ul><li><strong>Cost:</strong> 3 points</li><li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></li><li><strong>Tier 1 - 3:</strong> Ability to invoke the chosen boon</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> You are specialized in the use a particular boon that is iconic to your character. Examples of this feat in action include a druid who can shapechange at-will, a combat medic who can tend the wounds of many with expert skill, and a mad scientist who can animate mechanical minions effortlessly.</li><li><strong>Effect:</strong> Choose a single boon that you can invoke. You can benefits with that boon according to your tier in this feat.</li><li><strong>Tier 1</strong> - When you invoke the chosen boon on a single target, you succeed automatically and do not need to make an action roll. You can invoke the boon at any of the power levels you could access via your other means. If the invocation is not a single target, success is not automatic, but you get advantage 2 on the action roll to invoke the boon.</li><li><strong>Tier 2</strong> - You gain advantage 3 on your action roll to invoke the boon if you are not single-targeting. Additionally, you may invoke the boon one time increment faster, as follows: If the invocation time is a major action or move action, it becomes a minor action. If the invocation time is 1 focus action, it becomes 1 major action. If the invocation time is 1 minute, it becomes 1 focus action. If the invocation time is 10 minutes, it becomes 1 minute. If the invocation time is 1 hour, it becomes 10 minutes. If the invocation time is 8 hours, it becomes 1 hour. If the invocation time for a boon is 1 minor action, it can be invoked only once as a minor action. Beyond that it can be invoked by expending a move or major action.</li><li><strong>Tier 3</strong> - The effect at tier 3 varies based on the duration of the boon:</li></ul><div class="feat-entry"></div><hr><ul><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li><strong>If the chosen boon has a duration of “sustain persists”</strong>, you gain advantage 4 on your action roll to invoke if you are not single-targeting. Additionally, one instance of the boon can be sustained each round as a free action, rather than a minor action. If the boon is somehow temporarily cancelled, in the absence of other rules, you can invoke it again as a free action. If targeted by the <em>nullify</em> bane, this effect can only be canceled by a power level 6 or greater invocation of that bane.</li><li><strong>If the boon has a different duration</strong>, you gain advantage 5 on your action roll to invoke if you are not single-targeting.</li><li><strong>Special:</strong> In addition to purchasing multiple tiers of this feat, you may take this feat multiple times and select a new boon each time. Your tier of this feat is independent for each boon.</li></ul><h3 id="breakfall-i---ii">Breakfall (I - II)</h3><div class="feat-entry"></div><hr><ul><li><strong>Cost:</strong> 2 points</li><li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></li><li><strong>Tier 1 - 2:</strong> Agility 4</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> Your are as graceful as a swan.

During combat, your companion acts on its own initiative count and gains the usual assortment of actions, which you may choose. You also get to assign your companion’s attributes. Whenever you gain a level or purchase a new tier in this feat, you may reassign your companion’s attributes and feats.</li><li><strong>Tier 1</strong> - Your companion has a total of 20 attribute points plus 4 per level of your character.</li><li><strong>Tier 2</strong> - Your companion receives 3 feat points.</li><li><strong>Tier 3</strong> - Your companion has a total of 30 attribute points plus 6 per level of your character. In addition, you can optionally grant feats to your companion. In order to do so, you spend your own feat points and the companion receives the feat instead of you. The companion, not you, must meet all feat prerequisites. Any math related to these feats are calculated based on the companion’s attributes, feats, etc. If you have spent feat points this way and would gain feat points from any other effect, those feat points are reduced by the number of feat points you have granted to your companion.</li><li><strong>Special:</strong> If you ever lose your companion, voluntarily or involuntarily, you regain the feat points that you have spent on this feat and any of the companion’s feats, and may spend them as usual.</li></ul><p>In addition to purchasing multiple tiers of this feat, you may take this feat multiple times and select a new companion each time.</p><h3 id="craft-mundane-item-i---ii">Craft Mundane Item (I - II)</h3><div class="feat-entry"></div><hr><ul><li><strong>Cost:</strong> 2 points</li><li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></li><li><strong>Tier 1 - 2:</strong> Learning 3, Logic 3, or Knowledge I</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> You have mastered a particular craft, and given proper time and materials, you can create items related to that craft. You might be an expert blacksmith, professional engineer, master alchemist, or any similar manner of professional craftsman.</li><li><strong>Effect:</strong> Choose a specific craft or profession. You can create items that are relevant to your chosen craft, and your GM will determine the speed at which you craft based on the nature of the item and the materials you have access to. Your tier in the Craft Mundane Item feat determines the maximum wealth level of the items you can craft. Unlike acquiring items by using your wealth (described in Chapter 5), crafting does not limit your ability to acquire additional goods.</li><li><strong>Tier 1</strong> - Craft items equal to your wealth level.</li><li><strong>Tier 2</strong> - Craft items equal to your wealth level + 1.</li></ul><p><strong>Craft Examples</strong> (This list is not exhaustive, and you can work with your GM to come up with other suitable crafts). ___ - Alchemy - acid, chemicals, non-magical tinctures, incense, reagents - Arcane - magical ingredients, inks, scrolls, exotic components - Blacksmithing - metal, leather, weapons, armor, wheels, horseshoes - Chemistry - acid, explosives, narcotics - Engineering - machines, wheels, gears, guns, vehicles - Geography - maps, cartography, instruments of navigation - Herbalism - poultices, natural remedies, stimulants, brewing - Medicine - medical tools, tonics, tinctures, pain relievers, anti-toxins</p><ul><li><strong>Special:</strong> In addition to taking multiple tiers of this feat, you may take this feat multiple times and select a new craft or profession each time.</li></ul><h3 id="craft-extraordinary-item-i---iii">Craft Extraordinary Item (I - III)</h3><div class="feat-entry"></div><hr><ul><li><strong>Cost:</strong> 3 points</li><li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></li><li><strong>Tier 1 - 3:</strong> Learning 5, Logic 5, or any Extraordinary 5</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> You are studied in the ways of imbuing magical items, building futuristic technology, brewing potions, or crafting extraordinary devices. Their power is permanent but varies depending on your skill.</li></ul><div class="footnote">CHAPTER 3: FEATS</div><div class="feat-entry"></div><hr><ul><li></li><li></li><li></li><li><strong>Effect:</strong> Provided you have the appropriate working space and materials (as determined by the GM), you can create extraordinary items (as detailed in Chapter 9: Special Equipment). You can only imbue an item with attributes, banes, and boons that you can access. For example, in order to create a sword with Energy 5, you must possess an Energy score of 5 or higher. The only exception to this is if you possess the Creation, Learning, or Logic attributes. These allow you to imbue items with any attribute, bane, or boon as long as their value is less than or equal to your attribute score. The GM may rule that certain uses of Creation, Learning, or Logic are unreasonable when it comes to crafting extraordinary items.</li></ul><p>Your tier in this feat determines the maximum wealth level of the items you can create, based on the attribute you are using to craft:</p><ul><li><strong>Tier 1</strong> - Maximum wealth level is attribute minus 2.</li><li><strong>Tier 2</strong> - Maximum wealth level is attribute minus 1.</li><li><strong>Tier 3</strong> - Maximum wealth level is attribute.</li></ul><p>For example, a character with Creation 5 and tier 1 in this feat could create items up to wealth level 3.</p><p>You can determine the wealth level of the item you want to create by consulting the sample items in <strong>Chapter 9: Special Equipment</strong> or by developing a custom item using the rules for <strong>Building Your Own Extraordinary Items</strong> in that chapter.</p><p>Creating an item with the <em>consumable</em> property requires one full 8-hour day of uninterrupted work. Other items require a duration of uninterrupted work based on their wealth level, as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Wealth Level 1 - 3</strong>: Two days per wealth level</li><li><strong>Wealth Level 4 - 5</strong>: Four days per wealth level</li><li><strong>Wealth Level 6 - 7</strong>: One week per wealth level</li><li><strong>Wealth Level 8 - 9</strong>: One month per wealth level</li></ul><p>At the end of this time, your item is created. Crafting an item still counts as an expenditure of wealth, so you must have a sufficient wealth score to purchase the item, following all the rules for spending wealth provided in <strong>Chapter 5: Wealth &amp; Equipment</strong>. The GM may waive some or all of the costs associated with an item if you possess special materials for the crafting of your item. For example, if you have recently collected the hide of a slain red dragon and decide to make a suit of Armor of Fire Resistance, the GM may decide that the dragon’s hide is enough to make up most of the costs of the armor, so the armor’s wealth level is reduced by 3 for purposes of determining crafting costs.</p><h3 id="crushing-blow">Crushing Blow</h3><div class="feat-entry"></div><hr><ul><li><strong>Cost:</strong> 3 points</li><li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></li><li><strong>Tier 1:</strong></li><li>Might 6</li><li>Overpowering Strike</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> Like a reckless ogre wading through combat, your relentless blows not only knock your opponents back, but also knock them off their feet completely.</li><li><strong>Effect:</strong> Any time that you deal damage to an enemy, in addition to pushing them 5 feet (if you choose) from the Overpowering Strike feat, you can also knock them down in the space where the forced move ends; the target suffers the effects of the <em>knockdown</em> bane.</li></ul><h3 id="death-blow-i---ii">Death Blow (I - II)</h3><div class="feat-entry"></div><hr><ul><li><strong>Cost:</strong> 3 points</li><li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></li><li><strong>Tier 1:</strong></li><li>Agility 6</li><li>Lethal Strike I</li><li><strong>Tier 2:</strong></li><li>Agility 7</li><li>Lethal Strike III</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> You are able to quickly finish off enemies that are near death and silence them before they cry out.

Your hallucination may only target a single creature and is not eligible for multi-targeting attacks.</li><li><strong>Tier 2</strong> - When you invoke the hallucination form of the <em>phantasm</em> bane, you may target additional creatures within range as determined by your Influence score.

At the conclusion of the group invocation, each contributor may choose one of the effects granted by Tier 1 of this feat.</li><li>You gain the following additional options to choose from when empowering your invocations with heightened invocation: ___<ul><li>Cause a boon to persist for 1 minute automatically without needing to use a sustain action. Furthermore, enemies cannot end the boon through use of a disrupting attack (though the <em>nullify</em> bane still works).</li><li>Targets may not make resist rolls against a bane for one minute after it is invoked.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Tier 3</strong> - You gain the ability to permanently bestow or dispel banes and boons. In order to bestow the bane or boon, you must rigorously attend to the invocation process for a number of days equal to the power level of the bane or boon to be invoked or nullified. During that time you can eat, sleep, and act normally with two exceptions: 1) You must work actively on the invocation and with minimal interruption for 8 hours out of each day. 2) You can leave the area and move about freely during the down time each day, but for the 8 hours of active heightened invocation you must be in the same physical or geographic location where the invocation was initiated.

The target can thereafter invoke the boon at will with a free action, without requiring an action roll to do so. The target does not need to use a sustain action to persist the effect, and the effect can only be nullified either temporarily with the <em>nullify</em> bane, or permanently with the Heightened Invocation feat (see the Dispel Boon entry that follows).</li><li><strong>Bestow Bane</strong> - Make an action roll to invoke the bane as usual. If successful, you cause a non-instantaneous &amp; non-permanent bane to permanently affect the target. The bane persists indefinitely and does not allow resist rolls to end its effects. The effect can be cancelled either temporarily with the <em>nullify</em> bane, or permanently with the Heightened Invocation feat (see the Dispel Bane entry that follows).</li><li><strong>Dispel Boon</strong> - Make an Entropy roll with a Challenge Rating equal to 10 + twice the power level of the boon you are attempting to dispel. If successful, you cause a permanent boon to be forever stripped from the target, causing them to lose the ability to invoke the boon automatically.</li><li><strong>Dispel Bane</strong> - Make a Protection roll with a Challenge Rating equal to 10 + twice the power level of the bane you are attempting to dispel. If successful, you break the curse of a permanent bane afflicting the target, though your target gains no special immunity to it.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Special:</strong> Permanently bestowing banes or boons via this feat can dramatically impact the mechanical balance of a story. Just as with other permanent effects like Extraordinary Item creation, the invocation of permanent banes or boons is subject to GM’s discretion, and using this feat in a way that makes one particular character overly powerful should be prohibited.</li></ul><h3 id="hospitaler">Hospitaler</h3><div class="feat-entry"></div><hr><ul><li><strong>Cost:</strong> 2 points</li><li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></li><li><strong>Tier 1:</strong> Creation 4, Presence 4, or Protection 4</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> Through inspiring words, magical healing, or advanced medical technique, you are exceptionally skilled at helping others shake off baneful afflictions.

This feat is common among snipers, fighter pilots, and war wizards.</li><li><strong>Effect:</strong> When you take this feat, select one weapon or attack type.

When making attacks using your chosen weapon, your attribute is considered 1 greater for the purposes of determining attribute dice. Your attribute is not changed for purposes of feats, banes, boons, or similar items. Because of your intense focus on a single combat style, any damaging attacks that you make which do not use your martial focus suffer disadvantage 1.</li></ul><h3 id="master-tracker">Master Tracker</h3><div class="feat-entry"></div><hr><ul><li><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 point</li><li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></li><li><strong>Tier 1:</strong> Perception 4</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> You were made for the hunt. Whether you gained this ability through years of practice or possess it through heightened senses, the effect is the same: once you’ve picked up a trail, you almost never lose track of your quarry.</li><li><strong>Effect:</strong> Unless blinded or thwarted through extraordinary means, you always know the direction of true north. In addition, once you successfully locate the trail of a target, you automatically succeed at all tracking attempts to continue following that trail for 7 days after the time you first picked it up. Only extraordinarily concealed tracks, targets in flight, or similarly exceptional cases can cause you to lose your mark.</li></ul><h3 id="mimic">Mimic</h3><div class="feat-entry"></div><hr><ul><li><strong>Cost:</strong> 2 points</li><li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></li><li><strong>Tier 1:</strong> Alteration 4 and Deception 3</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> You have honed your shapeshifting abilities to be able to not only change your form, but to even imitate specific creatures. Your powers may stem from studying the arts of deceptive magic, from a gene mutation, or even from innate extraordinary abilities.</li><li><strong>Effect:</strong> When you use the <em>shapeshift</em> boon, you may take on the features of a specific creature. For example, instead of merely transforming into an elf, you can assume the guise of Galdion the elven king. The disguise is near perfect for those examining you visually. If your behavior or other signs provide reasonable suspicion, an onlooker can attempt a Perception roll with a Challenge Rating equal to 10 + triple your Alteration or Deception score, whichever is higher. If they succeed, they will recognize your disguise.</li></ul><h3 id="multi-attack-specialist-i---vi">Multi-Attack Specialist (I - VI)</h3><div class="feat-entry"></div><hr><ul><li><strong>Cost:</strong> 3 points</li><li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></li><li><strong>Tier 1 - 6:</strong> None</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> Whether you are delivering a flurry of blows, wielding two weapons, or calling a chain of lightning bolts from the sky, you have mastered the art of delivering multiple attacks.</li><li><strong>Effect:</strong> At the start of your turn, you may declare that you are multi-attacking. You must state how many extra attacks you would like to make. You receive a corresponding number of additional major actions, which can only be used for attacks. <em>All</em> of your attacks this round suffer disadvantage equal to 3 times the number of <strong>additional</strong> attacks you declare (i.e., if you make 2 attacks, you suffer disadvantage 3; 3 attacks suffers disadvantage 6). For each tier of this feat that you possess, reduce the disadvantage penalty by 1. You may use your attacks to make any combination of bane or damaging attacks, but you may not invoke boons. Resolve each attack individually, applying any other multi-targeting options as you wish. You can move between each of these attacks and they can be used to target the same creature more than once. The number of additional attacks you can make with this feat is limited to 1 + half your level, rounded up. Thus, the limit is 2 additional attacks at 1st level, 3 additional attacks at 3rd level, and 6 additional attacks at 9th level.</li><li><strong>Example</strong> - Vax the Deathbringer has Multi-Attack Specialist (Tier III). He declares that he will be making three attacks this round (two additional attacks). Therefore, all of his attacks suffer disadvantage 3 (3 x 2 = 6, minus 3 for feat tier 3). His first attack is a necromantic burst targeting a 10’-cube. Because of the area of effect, Vax suffers an additional disadvantage 2, making his total disadvantage for that attack 5. For his second attack, Vax casts a spell of blindness on a single foe, making an action roll at disadvantage 3. For his final attack, Vax moves in to melee and uses his touch of death on three foes. Targeting 3 foes incurs an additional disadvantage 3, making his final attack roll suffer a total of disadvantage 6.</li></ul><h3 id="multi-bane-specialist">Multi-Bane Specialist</h3><div class="feat-entry"></div><hr><ul><li><strong>Cost:</strong> 3 points</li><li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></li><li><strong>Tier 1:</strong> Ability to inflict both banes (see description)</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> You have mastered a signature attack that allows you to invoke two banes at once.

You are able to inflict both banes with a single attack. The required attribute score for combining the banes is equal to the sum of their power levels (e.g., combining <em>knockdown</em> and <em>slowed</em>, both power level 1, would require an attribute score of 2). If the banes target different defenses, you choose which defense your attack targets. On a successful attack roll, the target is inflicted with both banes. They each persist independently of one another and must be resisted separately.</li><li><strong>Special:</strong> In order to benefit from the bane focus feat when using a multi-bane attack, you must possess bane focus for both banes.</li></ul><p>You may take this feat more than once.
