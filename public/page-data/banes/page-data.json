Polymorph might be accomplished by a druid's curse, a mad scientist's transmogrification ray, or exposure to alien radiation.\n","duration":"Resist ends (Fail x 3 = 1 hour)","effect":"Your power level determines the extent to which you can transform your target, as follows. If the target is transformed into a different creature, it uses the Might, Agility, Fortitude, and Perception attribute scores of the new creature.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Power Level 5</strong> - Polymorph a creature into another creature of the same size. This new form can reduce the target's attribute scores by up to 2. If the new form would have higher attributes, the target becomes an exceptional version of that creature. For example, transforming a deadly sniper with Agility 5 into a clumsy ogre with Agility 0, would leave the target with an Agility of 3 instead of the 0 typical for the new form.</li>\n<li><strong>Power Level 6</strong> - Polymorph a creature into another creature between double and half the size. The new form can reduce the target's attribute scores by up to 3.</li>\n<li><strong>Power Level 8</strong> - Polymorph a creature into another creature between quadruple and one-quarter its original size. Alternatively, transform the target into an object of its original size. The new form can reduce the target's attribute scores by up to 5.</li>\n<li><strong>Power Level 9</strong> - Polymorph a creature into another creature of any size. Alternatively, transform the target into an object of its original size. The new form can reduce the target's attribute scores by up to 7.</li>\n</ul>\nIn order to keep track of hit points, the target should record the total damage they have suffered. When transforming, damage remains with the character even if their maximum hit points change. For example, Agent Walker has a max HP of 20 but is turned into a sheep and has her Fortitude reduced by 2, leaving her at 16 hit points. During combat, she suffers 10 damage. When she later transforms back into Agent Walker, the 10 damage remains and is subtracted from her new maximum, leaving her with 10 out of 20 hit points. Additionally, if the shift would reduce the target's hit points to less than 1, the target's hit point total becomes 1 instead.\n","id":"3fb35e9e-4932-5312-8e2a-bd14bdc590d6","invocationTime":"1 Minute","name":"Polymorph","power":[5,6,8,9],"special":null},{"attack":["Agility vs. Resolve","Creation vs. Resolve","Deception vs. Resolve","Energy vs. Resolve","Influence vs. Resolve","Might vs. Resolve","Persuasion vs. Resolve","Presence vs. Resolve"],"attackAttributes":["Agility","Creation","Deception","Energy","Influence","Might","Persuasion","Presence"],"description":"Through a display of awe-inspiring force, intimidation, or leadership, you command attention as the greatest threat, causing others to fear attacking your allies.
